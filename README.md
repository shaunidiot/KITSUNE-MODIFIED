A PHP implementation of Club Penguin's latest protocol.

## What this source includes:
* Fixed exploits
  * String injection (Thanks to Dev for an explanation)
  * Double login
  * Coin glitch
  * Several packet-checks (sorta like shields against PCL)
  * The so called "item rape" in PCL has been patched (this adds 8000 items)
  * Card-Jitsu gave all 509 cards, creating a huge packet to spam (DoS), see **Ninja.php**
  
* Added features that were missing in Kitsune

  * Puffle walk has been added (Coded by Dev, idea by Zaseth)
  * Puffle adoption has a word filter
  * Redemption
  * A rank system

  **And much more features have been added, just too many to list here.**

  * Anti spam (Fixed by Dev)
